      <strong>04/11/2021:</strong> 👋 <strong>Costco</strong> locations are now
      being scanned nationwide! I've also been making some underlying
      improvements so that any detected appointments will show up on the website
      even more quickly. Hope these changes help! Any feedback is welcome:

      coder and have interest in helping out on
      <a href="https://github.com/GUI/covid-vaccine-finder/issues">GitHub</a>,
      that would be dandy (although the code's still messy)!
