# COVID-19 Vaccine Spotter

A tool to help you track down COVID-19 vaccine appointment openings at your state's pharmacies. The code behind https://www.vaccinespotter.org.

## UI Development Setup

Requirements:

- Node.js 14+
- Yarn

This process is clunky right now, so my apologies.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/GUI/covid-vaccine-spotter.git`
2. Install dependencies (inside the repo): `yarn install`
3. Fetch data from the [API](https://www.vaccinespotter.org/api/) for the website to run: `yarn setup`
4. To run the development server for the website: `yarn dev`. The development site should then be available at http://localhost:3000/.

## DB and Backend Development Setup

docker-compose is used to bring up a local postgres DB. Then an image runs to bootstrap the database with states and postal codes. Finally, as an example of a backend task running, a container runs the `refresh-website` task.

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

To run additional tasks, you can use `docker-compose run`:

```
docker-compose run --rm --no-deps task_runner bin/refresh-cvs
```

## Very Beta API

All of the data being collected is published as JSON files here: https://www.vaccinespotter.org/api/

## Website Language Translations

### Contributing Translations

If you would like to help translate the website content into other languages, thank you! You can perform translations and add additional languages at [Localazy](https://localazy.com/p/vaccinespotter).

### Developer Translation Workflow

1. If you're adding new text to the website, just wrap the English text with the `$t` helper, like `$t('my text here...')`.
2. In order to translate these strings into other languages, and you have permissions to Localazy, then the steps are:
   1. Run `./bin/run locale:extract` to extract any new strings into the `website/lang/messages.pot` file.
   2. Run `./bin/run locale:upload` to upload the updated `website/lang/messages.pot` file to Localazy.
   3. After translations are performed, run `./bin/run locale:download` to download the resulting language files.
